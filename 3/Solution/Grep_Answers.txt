Problem 1:
	
1) ls -l | grep -E 'rwxrwxrw-'

2) ls -l | grep -c "Aug"

3) ls -l | awk -F" " 'BEGIN{mega=1048576} {$5 = $5/mega "MB"} {print}'
   or
   ls -l --block-size=M

4) ls -l | grep -c -v -e "Sep" -e "total"


Problem 2:
	//use words.txt for this!	

1) Write a command to list the output the name of words that contain the
letter ’z’ followed by any single character, followed by a letter ’a’

	egrep "z.a" words.txt 
	// . is used to match any character except new line!

2) Write a command to list all the words that contain ”apple”, ”papaya” and
”kiwi” as a string or substring

	egrep -e "apple" -e "papaya" -e "kiwi" words.txt
	// -e is used for multiple pattern search

3) Write a command to list all the words start with ”abid”.

	grep "^abid" words.txt

	// ^ is used to signify the start of a line!

4) Write a command to list all the words that end with ”ever”

	grep "ever$" words.txt
	//$ is used to signify the end of a line!

5) Write a command to list all the words that contain 4 vowels (a,e,i,o and u) in a  	consecutive manner (Note: the vowel sequence may be repeated).
	
	aeiou
	egrep -e ".*a.*e.*i.*o.*" -e ".*a.*e.*i.*u.*" -e ".*a.*e.*o.*u.*" -e ".*a.*i.*o.*u.*" -e ".*e.*i.*o.*u.*" words.txt 

	// (.*) can be used as a wild card match for any number of any characters
	// (.+) can be used as a wild card match for atleast one charcater!


6) Write a command to list all the words that are 8 characters long and print
it in reverse alphabetic order.
	
	egrep "^.{8}$" words.txt | tac

	// ^.{8} gives me all the words of length 8 present in the file
	// tac which is opposite of cat would print the list in reverse alphabetic order


7) Write a command to list all the words that start with letter ’m’ or ’n’ and
	contain a string ”oon”.

	egrep -c -e "^m.*oon.*" -e "^n.*oon.*" words.txt

	// ^is that words start from m and .* is for any number of charcaters!
