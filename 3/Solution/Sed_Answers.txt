	//Using Multiple Files

Problem 3

1)Command to output the content of file email_old.txt to the new file email_new.txt with all ”ernet.in” replaced with ”ac.in”.

	sed 's/ernet.in/ac.in/g' email_old.txt > email_new.txt

	//g is used to indicate that changes shoudl be made to all the ernet.in and not just specfic!

2) Replace all the WORDS "public" with "private" in the file QuizProgram.java
	
	//Note that we have to replace words and not strings using sed!

	sed 's/\bpublic\b/private/g' QuizProgram.java
	sed 's/\<public\>/private/g' QuizProgram.java

	// \b is used to match a word Boundary!

3) Replace multiple '!' with a single full stop(period)

	sed -e 's/\([!]\)\1\+/./g' -e 's/!/./g' msg.txt
	sed 's/!!*/./g' msg.txt
	sed -E 's/!{1,}/./g' msg.txt

4) Change American time format (May 12, 2010) to European Time Format(12 May 2010)

	sed -E 's/([A-Z][a-z]{2}) ([0-9]{2}), ([0-9]{4})/\2 \1 \3/g' date.txt

	//{n} means that match exactly n times!
	//{n,} means match atleast n times
	//{n,m} means match atleast n times but not more than m times!
	
	//[A-Z][a-z]{2} is equivalent to [A-Z][a-z][a-z] which means that first character must be an UPPER CASE letter followed by two lower case letters!
